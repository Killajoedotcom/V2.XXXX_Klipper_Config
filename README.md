# V2.XXXX Klipper Config
This is the config of my Voron V2.4 300 LDO Kit Serial:V2.XXXX

Be aware I see my config as WIP and it can and will change from time to time. I normally do only checkin stuff that is tested and run with the base klipper branch. I am not a developer and use this repo as sort of a backup to house my configuration.
